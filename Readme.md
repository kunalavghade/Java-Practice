# Obeject Oriented Programming

## Concepts
- Obeject
- Class
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphysum

### Obeject
- It is Real world Entity
- It has properties
- Task to be performed
- Instance of class

Ex:- Human -> 
- properties : name, age , gender
- Task : walk(), Run(), Read(), Write()


### Class
- Blue Print that Object Follows
- Number of objects
- Has menthods
- communication between class through object

Ex:- Student->
- properties : name, age , gender
- menthod : Read(), Write(), Play()

### Abstraction
- Showing only Essential parts 
- hiding the Implemenetation
- Achived by interface and Abstraction

### Encapsulation
- Binding variables and method under single Entity

Ex:-
|   Class   |   Student   |
|-----------|-------------|
| variables |  Name, Roll |
|  Methods  |  Read(), Write(), Play() | 

### Inheritance
- Acquiring the properties of another class
- Base Class -> Derived class or super Class -> sub class

Types:
- Single Inheritance
- Multi-level Inheritance
- Hierachical Inheritance

### Polymorphisum
- Performing same task in different way
- Method overloading : complietime
- Method overriding  : Runtime
Ex:- add(a,b), add(a,b,c)
